# Cannibalize_Midoride
Analyzing the market dynamics and Revitalizing Brand Strategy for Market Cannibalization of an Injectable Anesthesia Drug. 

The anesthesia drug market is a segment of the pharmaceutical industry that focuses on the development, production, and distribution of medications used to induce and maintain anesthesia during medical procedures and surgeries. The market for anesthesia drugs encompasses a wide range of pharmaceutical products, including general anesthetics, local anesthetics, and adjunctive drugs that support the anesthesia process. The demand for these drugs is closely tied to the healthcare industry, as the number of surgical procedures, including both routine and complex surgeries, continues to grow worldwide. Factors such as an aging population, increased healthcare access, and advancements in medical technology contribute to the expansion of the anesthesia drug market. 

As a Healthcare Commercial Analytics leader working for anesthesia drugs portfolio at a big pharma company, understanding market dynamics and making evidence-based decisions are crucial for the success of the business. The company has a market leading brand (Product 1) in the anesthesia portfolio. The Company also has recently launched a variant of the same brand (Product 2) in the market which is supposed to cannibalize the leading brand. (Market cannibalization is a loss in sales caused by a company's introduction of a new product that displaces one of its own older products in the market. The cannibalization of existing products need not necessarily lead to an increase in the company's overall market share, but at least the sales growth for the new product should be at the expense of the drop in sales of the old product.)

However, the expected cannibalization is not happening in the market. It appears that instead of your new product capturing the dropping sales of your old product, one of your competitors (Product 3) is rapidly gaining market share, leaving your new product (Product 2) to lose its expected market share.
